# React Router + Query experiment

A small project where I'm playing around with how React Router new data loading features would work with React-Query library.

The project uses vite + typescript + react-router + react-query + vitest

### Code Structure

Merging this 2 packages together introduced quiet a bit of verbosity, so I needed to create quiet a bit of abstractions & helper functions to improve & reduce the amount of boilerplate,

However, I believe that it can still be improved a bit.
So if you have any idea or advice for a place where things can be improved, please open a PR or an issue.
